# Bennet Silverman Portfolio (Frontend)

## Directing portfolio redesign

Backend repo [here](https://github.com/CutlerSheridan/bennet-silverman-backend).

#### TODO NEXT

#### TODO LATER

##### Features

##### Behavior

- stop hamburger links from loading twice
- make sure <Link> is only used for _internal_ links (e.g. not instagram)

##### Style

##### Notes

- Project taken over after 1.0 from Ryan Johnson
- Not familiar with Gatsby or Sass so everything bootstrapped from there
- all .css files originate from me

##### NOTES FOR BENNET

- for landing video, he should have a video on vimeo called "current reel," then also have one called "2024 directing reel" or whatever that's the same video, but current reel should always be updated and it'll auto-update on the site
- recommend keeping selected video count to multiples of 3

#### CHANGELOG

_2.0.6_

- clean up comments

_2.0.5_

- darken background so overscroll matches shaded page edge
- remove WorksGrid link styling in SquiggleLink.tsx so each button's ::after background is only controlled by index.css
